# Integrations Docs (Busbud + Eagleliner)

## What this folder is
This folder contains documentation for the **Busbud + Eagleliner integration layer** only.

It is intentionally separate from broader system documentation.

## Files
- `backend-busbud-eagleliner.md`
- `frontend-busbud-eagleliner.md`

## How to update these docs (append-only version history)
Each doc contains a `## Version history (append-only)` section.

When you make an integration change:
1. Add a new entry at the **top** of the Version history section.
2. Include:
   - Date
   - Version tag (you choose the scheme)
   - Short bullet list describing what changed
   - Optional: link/ID of the git commit
3. **Do not delete old entries.**

This gives an "in-doc" history in addition to normal git history.
